Java-Intern-Task-Anakatech

## How to play
The game starts when you run Game.java file. After that you can choose the difficulty level and the game begins! All the coordinates you need to put MUST be in range of the board and to be integers. The x and y must be separated by a space.

## Technology used
Java 11, IntelliJ IDEA

## JUnit Tests
Some JUnit test are written in order to check the functionality of the methods in Minesweeper.java and Coordinates.java.

## Other notes
I could implement the task using Spring Boot and Maven cause I've got experienced with these frameworks from the university, if I have more than 1 day to complete the game.
